# book-collection

a simple library for books, where you can store and update your library daily. 
you can check the book read status and update when completed with ease. that's pretty much how it works. 

add book button would allow the user to enter the details of the book and can store the data, which will display on the page for your convinience. and can track your status of the book(though only whether you read or not). delete button would allow you to delete the book from the list and can't be re-tracked again.
